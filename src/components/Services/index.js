                Are dental treatments very painful? We deliver a Local
                Anaesthetic solution before any of our treatments, which will
                numb that particular area, making the treatment a hassle free
                experience. Post the treatment, after the anaesthesia subsides,
                there will be a mild post-operative pain which can be managed
                following the doctor’s instructions. Do not Google your pain and
                always contact our doctors first before diagnosing your
                condition on Google websites or WebMD.
